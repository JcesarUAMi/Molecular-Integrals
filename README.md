# Gaussian Molecular Integration Library

## Description of the Method.

The algorithm is based in the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) method to solve the one- and two-electron integrals. We employed a non-recursive method to evaluate the MD equations. 
One advantage of the method is its capability to evaluate the two-electron integrals up to j angular momentum. 

The library was built with C++/SYCL in order to make it heterogenous.
